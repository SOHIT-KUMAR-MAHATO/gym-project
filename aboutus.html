        <p >“The fitness industry has witnessed a massive growth in recent years, especially after the Covid19 pandemic, becoming more diverse in terms of services and facilities it offers. Job opportunities in the field have also increased greatly as more and more people have become concerned about following a healthy lifestyle and working with a good gym trainer to remain healthy and fit,” says Shweta Pal, Fit India Ambassador and most fit vlogger of 2020.</p><br>
        <p >A fitness instructor is someone who trains, leads and motivates people or a group of individuals in exercising activities. If you aim to become a fitness trainer then you have to accept the fact that your physique will be viewed as your business card in the professional field. But beyond image, what matters is what you can offer those you train.</p><br>
        <p >Today's personal training industry is filled with inexperienced trainers hinging on their own gyming experiences to train others. Even the ones who may have some knowledge of fitness aren't exactly great teachers. One wonders, what sets great fitness trainers from the rest in this very competitive space? Here's taking a look at 5 top qualities that all good fitness instructors must have:</p><br>
        <p >-Ability to simplify: Often we find gym instructors who are so engrossed in showing off what they know that they lose out on the connect with their clients. While “knowledge is important”, as a gym coach your job is to teach someone the exercises and the importance of a healthy diet. The last thing you would want to do is make things too structured and complex. A good fitness instructor is one who moulds instructions in a language his clients can easily understand.</p><br>
        <p >-Maintains a pragmatic tone: In the contemporary world people want things done quickly. Unfortunately, that doesn't work in fitness. However, marketing strategies followed by the industry in the present time has created unrealistic expectations for people to follow. Trainers that care more about payments will often market quick solutions rather than creating realistic goals. A good fitness instructor is someone who doesn't fabricate expectations just to keep the client hooked and happy. They will communicate clearly and convey realistic goals to help clients continue their training in the correct way.</p><br>
